## Assignment Details
Using Node, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, build a RESTful full-stack web application to manage students and campuses.

This repository contains the client side webapp, which performs the following functions:
- Fetches data from backend/server
- Renders data to visually presentable form
- Provides the user with an interface to create, edit and delete entries, either students or campuses
- Makes appropriate API calls to backend to modify database as needed
